#### Introduction
Chat Assistant (referred to as "App") is developed and maintained by lingyu0. We are deeply aware of the importance of protecting personal information and privacy while providing users with a good user experience.

#### Personal Information
##### Email
Used for account registration/login and user feedback communication, we will not disclose to third parties. 
We do not collect any other personal information.

Any user request content is only forwarded to the OPEN AI API and no records or information are saved.

This App uses Microsoft App Center Analytics (referred to as "AppCenter") to help us understand and analyze the usage of the App. AppCenter only collects and aggregates non-personal information, so we will not receive any personally identifiable information. We only see aggregated data and statistics on overall App usage.
